#  Indecision-App

This project is a basic **React.js** application. The idea behind this project is to allow the user to make decisions easily and effectively. Firstly, the user has to add the options from which he wants to pick an option. On clicking the Indecision Button a random option is selected from the options added by the user which is then displayed to the user in a modal. **Sass** is used for styling the application. **Webpack** and **Babel** are some modules used for automation.
